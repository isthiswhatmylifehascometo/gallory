# Website Prompt for Jheel's Time-Based Greeting Site

## Visual Design Concept

Create a **modern, minimalist website** with a romantic, personalized touch. The design should feature:

- **Background**: A beautiful, soft romantic image - think dreamy landscapes, gentle sunrises/sunsets, or delicate floral patterns that evoke warmth and love
- **Text Overlay**: A frosted glass container positioned centrally over the background image
- **Typography**: Clean, modern fonts that are easy to read and feel contemporary
- **Color Palette**: Soft, warm tones that complement the romantic theme while maintaining readability

## Frosted Glass Text Container

The greeting message should appear in a **translucent container** with these characteristics:

- **Glass Effect**: Semi-transparent background with a subtle blur effect behind it
- **Shape**: Rounded corners for a modern, soft appearance
- **Positioning**: Centered on the page with appropriate padding around the text
- **Shadow**: Gentle drop shadow to create depth and separation from the background
- **Border**: Subtle light border to define the container edges

## Time-Based Greeting Messages

### Good Morning (4:00 AM - 11:59 AM)
*"Good morning Jheel! It's [current date] and you're still the prettiest girl in the world. Hope you have an amazing day and stay hydrated. ‚òÄÔ∏è"*

### Good Afternoon (12:00 PM - 4:49 PM)
*"Good afternoon beautiful! How's your day going so far? Remember, I'm always here for you no matter what. Hope you're taking care of yourself! üå∏"*

### Good Evening (5:00 PM - 10:59 PM)
*"Good evening gorgeous! Time to take some rest and have fun. You've worked hard today, so treat yourself to something nice. You deserve it! üåÖ"*

### Good Night (11:00 PM - 3:59 AM)
*"Goodnight princess, see you in my dreams. Rest well and wake up refreshed tomorrow. Sweet dreams! üåô‚ú®"*

## Technical Implementation Explanation

### How the Time Detection Works

The website needs to **automatically detect the current time** and display the appropriate message. This involves:

1. **Getting Current Time**: The system captures the user's local time when they visit the page
2. **Time Comparison**: It checks what hour it currently is (0-23 format)
3. **Message Selection**: Based on the hour, it selects the corresponding greeting message
4. **Dynamic Date**: The current date is automatically inserted into morning messages

### How the Frosted Glass Effect Works

The **frosted glass appearance** is achieved through:

1. **Background Transparency**: The container has a semi-transparent white background
2. **Backdrop Filter**: A blur effect is applied to whatever is behind the container
3. **Layering**: The text container sits on top of the background image with proper z-index
4. **Border Effects**: Subtle borders and shadows create the glass-like appearance

### How the Responsive Design Works

The website should **adapt to different screen sizes**:

1. **Flexible Container**: The text container adjusts its width based on screen size
2. **Scalable Text**: Font sizes adapt to ensure readability on mobile and desktop
3. **Background Scaling**: The background image covers the entire viewport regardless of device
4. **Touch-Friendly**: Spacing and sizing work well on touch devices

### How the Date Integration Works

For the morning message specifically:

1. **Date Formatting**: The system formats the current date in a readable format (e.g., "Monday, July 14, 2025")
2. **Dynamic Insertion**: This formatted date replaces the placeholder in the greeting text
3. **Localization**: The date appears in the user's local format and timezone

### Performance Considerations

The website should be **fast and efficient**:

1. **Lightweight Code**: Minimal JavaScript to check time and update content
2. **Optimized Images**: Background images compressed for quick loading
3. **Caching**: Static elements cached for repeat visits
4. **Instant Updates**: Time-based changes happen immediately without page refresh

This creates a **personalized, romantic experience** that feels fresh and special every time Jheel visits, while maintaining the clean, modern aesthetic you requested.
